      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a full‑stack software engineer who takes projects from rough concept to reliable,
        production‑ready software. I focus on clear architecture, small composable pieces, and
        code that another developer can understand and extend without friction.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        On the frontend, I work primarily with React and TypeScript to build focused, minimal
        interfaces that prioritize clarity and usability. On the backend, I’ve delivered APIs
        and internal tools using Django REST Framework, supported by relational databases such
        as PostgreSQL and MySQL.
      </p>

        My recent work includes a marketing site for a client, an event management dashboard,
        an iOS note‑taking app built with SwiftUI, and a Chrome extension for time calculations
        published on the Chrome Web Store. I enjoy projects that solve concrete problems, evolve
        through iteration, and leave room for thoughtful design.
