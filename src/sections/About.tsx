      <p>
        I’m a full‑stack software engineer focused on building clean, intentional,
        and maintainable systems. I care deeply about UI/UX, architecture, and
        creating expressive, modern interfaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of development, I’m always exploring new tools, refining workflows,
        and pushing for clarity and craftsmanship in everything I build.
      </p>
