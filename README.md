# Christian Morrow — Developer Portfolio  
A handcrafted, React‑powered portfolio built with intentional UI/UX, clean architecture, and expressive motion.

This project is a ground‑up build designed to showcase my engineering style: modular components, maintainable structure, handcrafted CSS, and a layout system that feels deliberate and signature.

---

## 🌐 Overview

This portfolio is built from scratch using a modern React + TypeScript + Vite stack.  
Every section — About, Skills, Projects, Contact — is structured around reusable components, custom CSS layers, and animation logic that supports directional stagger, hover overlays, and scroll‑based interactions.

Key goals of this project:

- Intentional UI/UX — layouts that feel designed, not templated  
- Clean architecture — modular components, readable structure  
- Maintainability — clear naming, reusable logic, scalable patterns  
- Expressive motion — animations that support meaning, not noise  

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript — component-driven, strongly typed  
- Vite — fast dev server and optimized builds  
- Custom CSS architecture — layout.css, animations.css, variables, grids  
- Reusable components — including a fully modular `ProjectCard`  
- Git discipline — feature branches, squash merges, clean commit history  

---

## 🎨 UI & Interaction Design

This portfolio emphasizes handcrafted UI over template-driven design.  
Some of the expressive elements include:

- Hover overlays on project cards  
- Directional stagger animations for section reveals  
- Scroll snapping for section‑to‑section flow  
- Responsive CSS grid tuned for desktop, tablet, and mobile  
- Minimalist, modern layout with intentional spacing and hierarchy  

---

## 🧩 Architecture & Components

The codebase is structured for clarity and scalability:

- ProjectCard component — extracted, reusable, animation‑ready  
- Section-based layout — About, Skills, Projects, Contact  
- CSS modules + global layers — animations, layout, variables  
- Data-driven rendering — project lists mapped from arrays  
- Clean folder structure — `src/components`, `src/sections`, `src/styles`  

This structure makes it easy to add new sections, animations, or components without refactoring the entire codebase.

## 🚀 Development Workflow

This portfolio project follows a professional Git workflow:

- Feature branches for isolated development  
- Pull requests for review and merge clarity  
- Squash merges for clean commit history  
- Descriptive commit messages documenting architectural decisions  

Recent work includes:

- Extracting `ProjectCard` into a reusable component  
- Refactoring the Projects section for maintainability  
- Adding hover overlays and preparing stagger animations  
- Cleaning and unifying layout and animation CSS layers
